Dockerizing simple Python, Go and Node.js applications

## How to test final results

#### Preparation

Firstly, clone this repository. Then,

```bash
$ npm install
```

#### Python

My experiments with Docker is [here](./PYTHON.md)

This will build and run Python Docker image

```bash
$ npm run python
```

#### Go

My experiments with Docker is [here](./GO.md)

This will build and run Go Docker image

```bash
$ npm run go
```

#### Node.js
